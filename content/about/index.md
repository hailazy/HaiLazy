Hi, I'm Hai!

I don't often talk about myself in public, not because [I'm an introvert](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/ff09012cf8595) (well, maybe a little), but because I believe actions speak louder than words. However, since you've taken the time to visit, you deserve to know a bit more about me than what you'll find on my LinkedIn page or social media profiles.

You probably already know that I'm a developer, but what you might not know is that I also wear the hat of the operations team leader at [Book!e](https://www.bookiecommunity.com/), a vibrant community of book enthusiasts. While I have a deep love for books themselves, it's the stories, facts, and opinions within them that truly captivate me.

One of the things I enjoy most is listening to people share their stories and engaging in spirited discussions to uncover meaningful insights together.

Friends often describe me as dedicated, thoughtful, and meticulous. Helping others brings me immense joy and serves as a constant source of inspiration. It's a rare sight to see me turn down a request for assistance. I believe this might be because I don't always take the initiative to connect with people (something I'm working on!), so when someone reaches out for help, it makes me feel truly appreciated.

So, whether you're in need of assistance or just looking for someone to join you on a trekking adventure, share a cup of coffee, or even engage in some friendly video game competition...hehe, don't hesitate to [drop me a line](https://www.facebook.com/HaiLazy.IT/) or [email](mailto:thanhhai9x98@gmail.com) me. I'm here to lend a hand and make meaningful connections along the way.
